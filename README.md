# VBA of Wall Street: Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help Steve create a stock analysis tool that he can use to analyze stock performances and provide investment recommendations to his clients. To complete this task, I have analyzed sets of stock data for two different years using VBA code within the developer extension of Excel. Steve is now able to use the macros I wrote to run a stock analysis with the click of a button, and can then analyze the data to help his first client, his parents, make valuable and insightful investments.
